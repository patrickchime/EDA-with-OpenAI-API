# Exploratory Data Analysis with OpenAI API

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence is disrupting the way people do work now. OpenAI is one of the leading AI organizations which rolled out an LLM called GPT that accepts natural language as a prompt and gives response based on the user prompt. 

Data science is a field that will be highly impacted by this AI wave. There are many ways in which AI can be helpful in data analysis workflow. By leveraging AI, data analysts can streamline their workflows, gain deeper insights, and make more informed decisions based on the data at hand.


Here, I have used OpenAI API together with LangChain to build a simple data analysis bot.  This project requires that we harness the potential of OpenAI's API, specifically using its state-of-the-art language model, GPT-3.5 Turbo, to create an AI-powered bot that will help us in our data analysis project. Such tasks include; suggesting data analysis questions and answering follow up questions from the user based on the dataset provided.


## Requirements
1. You need to get an OpenAI API before embarking on this task
2. Install langchain and openai
